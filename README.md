### Execution

To run the whole system easily, execute the `run_all.sh` script. This will open four servers, as well as a client for communicating with them.

`run_client_search_ports.sh` will open a client that searches on a range of ports to find available peers. This is not recommended as it takes a long time to complete this process.
